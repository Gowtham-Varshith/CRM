# Expense Management System using MERN Stack

## Project Description:

The **Expense Management System** is a web-based application designed to assist users in tracking and managing their daily expenses. This system is built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js) to create a scalable, responsive, and user-friendly application.

## Objectives:

1. Simplify expense tracking for individuals and organizations.
2. Provide detailed insights into spending patterns to enable better financial management.
3. Offer a platform for users to create, update, and delete expenses and categories.
4. Generate comprehensive reports based on user-defined time periods and categories.

## Features

- **User Authentication and Authorization**:
  - Users can sign up and log in to their personal accounts using secure authentication mechanisms.
  - Implement role-based access control for administrative tasks.

- **Expense and Category Management**:
  - Enable users to create, update, and delete expense entries and categories.
  - Track expenses by date, category, and description.
  - Support attaching receipts or other relevant documents to expense entries.

- **Dashboard and Reporting**:
  - Provide a visual dashboard displaying an overview of the user's expenses, including total expenses, expenses by category, and recent transactions.
  - Generate reports based on selected date ranges and categories, displaying pie charts and bar graphs to help users understand their spending patterns.

- **Responsive User Interface**:
  - A clean, responsive UI that works seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
  - Built using **React.js** for building reusable UI components and managing state effectively.

## Technical Architecture:

- **Frontend**:
  - Built using **React.js** and libraries like **tsparticle** for background effects, and **unique-names-generator**, **react-datepicker**, **moment** for additional functionalities.
  - Implement responsive design using **Bootstrap** and **Material-Icons**.

- **Backend**:
  - Built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** to create a RESTful API.
  - Authentication and authorization handled using **JWT** (JSON Web Tokens) and middleware for protecting endpoints.

- **Database**:
  - **MongoDB** for storing data such as user information, expense entries, and categories.
  - **Mongoose** ORM for schema definition and validation.

- **Deployment**:
  - The frontend is deployed on **AWS**, and the backend on **Render**.
  - Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are set up for automated builds and deployments.
